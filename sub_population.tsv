EU	British in England and Scotland [GBR]	Moderate genetic diversity with influences from historical migrations and regional variations. Genetic profiles distinct from other European populations.	Rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes driven by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, sedentary behavior, and obesity. Socioeconomic deprivation exacerbates access to healthcare and healthy food options. Genetic predisposition plays a secondary role compared to environmental factors.	https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/British-from-England-and-Scotland-UK-GBR
SA	Gujrarti Indians in Houston, Texas, USA (diaspora population originating from Gujarat, India)[GIH]	High genetic diversity within the Gujarati subgroup, influenced by regional endogamy and migration patterns. Shares genetic traits with broader South Asian populations.	Elevated risk of type 2 diabetes due to genetic predisposition (insulin resistance, central obesity) and environmental factors (dietary shifts, sedentary lifestyle). Culturally tailored interventions have shown effectiveness in reducing diabetes risk.	https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/Gujarati-Indians-in-Houston-TX-USA-GIH
SA	Punjabi in Lahore, Pakistan [PJL]	The genetic diversity of Punjabis in Lahore reflects a mix of Indo-Aryan, Central Asian, and Persian heritage, highlighting the regions historical role as a meeting point for various civilisations.	Variants in the LPP and ZMIZ1 genes are linked to celiac disease in this population. Type 3 von Willebrand disease is prevalent due to genetic mutations influenced by consanguineous marriages. Furthermore, Ventricular Septal defects (VSD) have been linked to specific genetic risk factors in this population.	https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/Punjabi-in-Lahore-Pakistan-PJL
