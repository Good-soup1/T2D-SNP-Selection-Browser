Population	Sub_Population	Genetic Diversity & Relatedness	Disease & Trait Associations
SA (South Asian)	British in England and Scotland	Moderate genetic diversity with influences from historical migrations and regional variations. Genetic profiles distinct from other European populations.	Rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes driven by lifestyle factors such as poor diet, sedentary behavior, and obesity. Socioeconomic deprivation exacerbates access to healthcare and healthy food options. Genetic predisposition plays a secondary role compared to environmental factors.
SA (South Asian)	Gujrari Indians in Houston, Texas, USA (diaspora population originating from Gujarat, India)	High genetic diversity within the Gujarati subgroup, influenced by regional endogamy and migration patterns. Shares genetic traits with broader South Asian populations.	Elevated risk of type 2 diabetes due to genetic predisposition (insulin resistance, central obesity) and environmental factors (dietary shifts, sedentary lifestyle). Culturally tailored interventions have shown effectiveness in reducing diabetes risk.
