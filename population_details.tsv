SA (South Asian)	India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal	High genetic diversity due to caste endogamy and historical migrations. Distinct genetic signatures compared to East Asian and European populations.	Higher risk for coronary artery disease (due to Lp(a) levels). Increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes due to genetic and dietary factors.
EU (European Ancestry)	Western Europe (i.e. UK, Germany, France, Spain), Eastern Europe (i.e. Russia, Poland, Ukraine), Southern Europe (i.e. Italy, Greece)	Moderate genetic diversity due to ancient migrations and population mixing. Neolithic, Indo-European, and Viking ancestry influence different regions.	High prevalence of lactose persistence (LCT gene variant). Increased risk for Alzheimer's (APOE-Îµ4 allele) and type 1 diabetes.
AA (African American or Afro-Caribbean)	United States (Southeastern regions, Midwest, Northeast, etc.), Caribbean Islands (Haiti, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, etc.), Some samples from Brazil and other Latin American regions	High genetic diversity due to the transatlantic slave trade. Primarily West African ancestry, with varying degrees of European and Indigenous American admixture.	Increased risk for hypertension and type 2 diabetes due to genetic and environmental factors. Higher prevalence of sickle cell trait (HbS allele).
HS (Hispanic)	Mexico, Central America, South America, Caribbean (Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic)	Highly admixed: Indigenous American, European, African. Varies by region (e.g., higher Indigenous ancestry in Mexico, higher African ancestry in the Caribbean).	Higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes linked to Indigenous ancestry. Certain genetic variants associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.
EA (East Asian or Latin American)	China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, Thailand	Low to moderate genetic diversity due to strong population bottlenecks. Close genetic relation among East Asian populations with distinct subgroups (e.g., Han Chinese vs. Japanese).	Higher prevalence of lactose intolerance (MCM6 gene). Increased risk for esophageal and stomach cancer due to genetic predisposition.
